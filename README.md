# Linux File System Permissions Audit & Remediation
This project documents a lab-based audit of file system permissions within a large organization’s research environment. The objective was to verify that user permissions aligned with authorized access requirements and to remediate any misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized access.

# Scenario

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
